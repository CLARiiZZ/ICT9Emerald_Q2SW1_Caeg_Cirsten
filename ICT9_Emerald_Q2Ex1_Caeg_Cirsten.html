		<h3>Alfred Lord Tennyson</h3>
	    </div>

	    <div>
	    <p>He clasps the crag with crooked hands;<br>
	    Close to the sun in lonely lands,<br>
	    Ringed with the azure world, he stands.
        <br><br>
        The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;<br>
        He watches from his mountain walls,<br>
        And like a thunderbolt he falls.
